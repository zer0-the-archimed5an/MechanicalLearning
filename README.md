The Emergence of Behavior


This work introduces processual computation theory, a mathematical framework that examines knowledge systems through process orientation, with foundation models serving as an ideal exemplar at the intersection of theory and application. By developing processual computation theory and applying it to neural architectures, including their scaled manifestations as foundation models, and introducing the next level up, General Mechanical Intelligence, we identify recurring patterns that maintain structure across scales while increasing in abstraction. Drawing from operator theory, we propose new constructions for process-primary spaces that enable more rigorous analysis of modern AI systems. Our approach provides analytical tools for examining these advanced intelligent systems as both architectural entities and dynamic knowledge transformation processes. The framework demonstrates multi-level applicability: it offers theoretical foundations for understanding complex learning frameworks while implementing in its own structure the same processual patterns it identifies in these systems. The patterns we identify suggest that intelligence may emerge through consistent processual structures. This approach helps make neural networks more analytically tractable, revealing organizational patterns that were previously difficult to discern. Beyond advancing AI interpretability, our framework suggests new directions for understanding knowledge representation in complex systems.
